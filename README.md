##  Case Study Breakdown

The case study was divided into **3 parts**:

### 1.  Code Review & Debugging
- Identified issues like duplicate SKUs, lack of atomic transactions, and poor validation.
- Rewrote the product creation logic to ensure data consistency and better error handling.

### 2.  Database Design
- Designed scalable schema with products, inventory, suppliers, bundles, and history tracking.
- Used composite keys, indexes, and normalized relations for performance and maintainability.

### 3.  API Implementation
- Built a `/low-stock` alert API that:
  - Considers product-level thresholds
  - Filters only products with recent sales
  - Returns supplier contact info and days until stockout
